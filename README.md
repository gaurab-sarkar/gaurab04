### Project 2

### Prediction of transport/thermodynamical properties for click-chemistry compounds

[Publication](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2016.10.036)

This project focused on prediction of transport properties of thiol-ene/acrylate systems, components of 'click-chemistry' compounds, using molecular dynamics simulations. This data-driven approach, with the use of **NAMD** and alysed in **MATLAB**, led to an increase knowledge regarding various physical properties of the starting modular units used in the development of multi-faceted end user applications such as fabrication of materials from areas such as materials science, bioconjugation and drug delivery.
