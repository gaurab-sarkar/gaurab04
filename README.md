## Introduction

I am a recent PhD graduate in [Chemical and Biological Engineering](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological.html) from State University of New York, Buffalo, with interests in the domains of molecular simulations, molecular modeling, computational chemistry and its applications. Advised by [Dr. Jeffrey R. Errington](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological/people/faculty-directory/core.host.html/content/shared/engineering/chemical-biological/profiles/faculty/errington-jeffrey-r.detail.html), my doctoral disseration included building strategies for efficient carbon capture, utilization and storage systems with further work involving of modeling novel methods for accurate phase equilibrium calculations effective for use in pharmaceutical and petroleum industries.

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using Python. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more // // commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
